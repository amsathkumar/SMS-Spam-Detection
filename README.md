SMS Spam Detection using NLP
üìå Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect spam messages in SMS texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model identifies whether a message is Spam or Ham (non-spam) with high accuracy.

üîç Features
Preprocessing of raw SMS text data.
Feature extraction using NLP techniques (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF).
Classification using machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Evaluation of model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment-ready code (optional: integrated with a web app or API).
üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Contains 5,574 labeled SMS messages (4,827 ham and 747 spam).
üõ† Technologies and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
pandas (Data Manipulation)
nltk (Natural Language Processing)
matplotlib & seaborn (Visualization)
Flask/Streamlit (optional: for deployment)

üìä Workflow
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning SMS text (removing punctuation, stop words, and converting to lowercase).
Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Engineering:
Converting text data into numerical form using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
Model Training:
Training classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.
Evaluation:
Evaluating performance using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall
F1-Score
Deployment: (Optional)
Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time spam detection.
üìù Results
